# Introduction

## What is it?

Thermal compound (or commonly known as thermal paste) is used to spread heat generated from components to a heatsink (shown below).

Thermal paste applied to a CPU heatsink

Generally, it is composed of different materials (depending on the brand) ranging from
silicone to zinc oxide. While this usually doesn't change the paste's performance, there are some minor differences.

In regards to PC building and hardware, you really don't need a lot to get the job done since the most that you'll need to apply the thermal paste for is the CPU and/or the GPU.

For this reason, thermal paste can typically be bought in small quantities (less than 1 gram).
