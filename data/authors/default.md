Hey there!
My name's Edwin and I am a CS major at Chabot College. I am also the club president of Chabot's Computer Hardware Club, hence is why this blog site was even created in the first place.

When not experimenting with stuff on the web, you can find me playing a variety of games.

If you want to reach me, you can find me on Github and Discord. All my contacts + my email address are also listed.
